Audio spectrum Analyzer for Android.

I wrote this small (but potentially useful) Android app to experiment with and
understand various features of the Android SDK, including:

- Pan and pinch to zoom
- User preferences
- Custom attributes
- View animations
- Audio subsystem

Files:
- fftLibrary: a library project containing the FFT code
- audioAnalyzer: A simple android app to excersize the FFT library

I'm making this available in the hope that it is useful.
